# Testing

Our testing strategy encompasses multiple phases to ensure system reliability, performance, and scalability, targeting sub-100ms latency for real-time responsiveness.

## 10.1 Unit Testing with Mocks

Using Jest with TypeScript, we achieved 85% code coverage through component isolation testing.

### Mocking Strategy

- Mocked external dependencies:
  - PostgreSQL via PgBouncer (using jest-mock-extended)
  - PartyKit services (custom mock implementations)
  - Redis APIs (redis-mock library)
  - Auth providers (NextAuth.js test helpers)

### Key Test Cases

- WebSocket message validation using Zod schemas
- Authentication and session management flow
- Inventory allocation logic with race condition handling
- Business rules enforcement for product availability
- State synchronization between clients
- Form validation and error handling

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
// Component tests are organized by feature
// with separate test suites for happy paths and edge cases
// __tests__/features/inventory/InventoryManager.test.ts
```

## 10.2 Integration Testing

Tools leveraged:

- Cypress for end-to-end frontend testing
- Jest for backend route and database testing
- Mock Service Worker for API simulation

### Tested Scenarios

- Complete user journeys:
  - Account creation and authentication
  - Product browsing and filtering
  - Real-time inventory tracking
  - Checkout process
  - Payment processing (using test credentials)
- Real-time state synchronization across multiple clients
- Database transaction accuracy and rollback mechanisms
- API rate limiting and error handling

Early tests revealed WebSocket timing issues under high concurrency, resolved through Redis buffer optimization and message prioritization.

## 10.3 Performance Testing

Tools used:

- k6 for load testing and threshold validation
- Clinic.js for Node.js profiling (CPU, memory, event loop)
- Lighthouse for frontend performance metrics
- WebPageTest for global performance analysis

### Results

- Median WebSocket latency: 63ms
- 95th percentile latency: 92ms
- Sustained 10,000 concurrent connections
- Time to First Byte (TTFB): 120ms
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 1.2s
- Total Blocking Time (TBT): 150ms

### Optimizations

- PgBouncer connection pooling: 40% API response improvement
- Query optimization: 65% reduction in database load
- Redis data structure optimization: 30% memory reduction
- Vercel CDN integration: Sub-500ms global page loads
- Dynamic imports for non-critical components: 25% initial bundle size reduction

## 10.4 Simulation Testing

Artillery-based testing with scaled user loads and custom behavioral scripts:

### Test Scenarios

| Users  | Focus               | Simulated Actions                     |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 10     | Basic functionality | Browse, add to cart, checkout         |
| 100    | Real-time sync      | Concurrent item viewing and selection |
| 1,000  | Expected load       | Mixed actions with authentication     |
| 10,000 | Scale limits        | Stress testing during peak events     |

### Behavioral Patterns

- Random browsing paths
- Product category concentration
- Session duration variance
- Abandoned cart scenarios
- Checkout completion rate

### Performance Metrics

- 78ms average WebSocket latency at 10k users
- Redis: 50k writes/second, 200k reads/second
- PostgreSQL: 200+ concurrent transactions/second
- Error rate < 0.01% under normal load
- 99.99% uptime during simulated seasonal peaks

## 10.5 Load Balancer and Edge Network Testing

Validated global deployment across Vercel and PartyKit infrastructure using distributed testing agents.

### Testing Methodology

- Multi-region synthetic monitoring
- Chaos engineering (server/region failures)
- Network throttling and latency simulation
- DNS failover verification
- Cache invalidation testing

### Results

- Static asset latency: 32ms median (Vercel CDN)
- Real-time updates: Sub-50ms globally (PartyKit)
- Zero-downtime failover achieved
- CDN cache hit ratio: 96%
- API gateway resilience: 100% availability during simulated outages

## Summary

The testing strategy validated system capabilities across all critical metrics:

- Real-time responsiveness
- Global scalability
- High concurrency handling
- Data consistency
- Failover resilience

Tools like Jest, Cypress, k6, and Artillery confirmed the architecture's ability to maintain performance during high-demand events while delivering consistent global access. The implementation of canary deployments allows for gradual rollouts with automated regression testing to prevent service disruptions.
