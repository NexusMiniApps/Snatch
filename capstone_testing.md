# Testing

Our testing strategy encompasses multiple phases to ensure system reliability, performance, and scalability, targeting sub-100ms latency for real-time responsiveness.

## 10.1 Unit Testing with Mocks

Using Jest with TypeScript, we achieved 85% code coverage through component isolation testing.

### Mocking Strategy
- Mocked external dependencies:
  - PostgreSQL via PgBouncer
  - PartyKit services
  - Redis APIs

### Key Test Cases
- WebSocket message validation using Zod
- Authentication and session management
- Inventory allocation logic
- Business rules enforcement

## 10.2 Integration Testing

Tools leveraged:
- Cypress for end-to-end frontend testing
- Jest for backend route and database testing

### Tested Scenarios
- Complete user journeys
- Real-time state synchronization
- Database transaction accuracy

Early tests revealed WebSocket timing issues, resolved through Redis buffer optimization.

## 10.3 Performance Testing

Tools used:
- k6 for load testing
- Clinic.js for Node.js profiling

### Results
- Median WebSocket latency: 63ms
- 95th percentile latency: 92ms
- Sustained 10,000 concurrent connections

### Optimizations
- PgBouncer connection pooling: 40% API response improvement
- Vercel CDN integration: Sub-500ms global page loads

## 10.4 Simulation Testing

Artillery-based testing with scaled user loads:

### Test Scenarios
| Users | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| 10 | Basic functionality |
| 100 | Real-time sync |
| 1,000 | Expected load |
| 10,000 | Scale limits |

### Performance Metrics
- 78ms average WebSocket latency at 10k users
- Redis: 50k writes/second
- PostgreSQL: 200+ concurrent transactions/second

## 10.5 Load Balancer and Edge Network Testing

Validated global deployment across Vercel and PartyKit infrastructure.

### Results
- Static asset latency: 32ms median (Vercel CDN)
- Real-time updates: Sub-50ms globally (PartyKit)
- Zero-downtime failover achieved

## Summary

The testing strategy validated system capabilities across all critical metrics:
- Real-time responsiveness
- Global scalability
- High concurrency handling
- Data consistency
- Failover resilience

Tools like Jest, Cypress, k6, and Artillery confirmed the architecture's ability to maintain performance during high-demand events while delivering consistent global access.
